<!--The code is written in Handlebars, a templating language. It defines an ordered list, where for each post in the posts array, it includes a post-info-homepage partial, which displays information about the post, inside a list item element.

So it will generate an ordered list of post information, where each post is displayed in a separate list item.-->
