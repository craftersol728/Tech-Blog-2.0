  //*The code defines an asynchronous function logout that sends a HTTP POST request to the "/api/users/logout" endpoint. The request includes a header with the content type set to "application/json". If the response from the server is successful (status code in the 200-299 range), the function replaces the current document's location with the root URL "/". If the response is not successful, the function displays an alert with the response's status text.The code also attaches an event listener to an HTML element with the ID "logout". When this element is clicked, the logout function will be executed.In summary, this code implements a logout functionality that sends a request to the server to log out the current user, and redirects the user to the root URL if the logout is successful.
